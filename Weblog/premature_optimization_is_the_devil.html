    <h1>Log 1 - Premature Optimization is the Devil</h1>
    <h2>LJC || 11.28.24 </h2>

    <p>
        Premature optimization is the root of all evil in programming. Donald
        Knuth himself said this in _The Art of Computer Programming_ which was
        originally published in 1968. Yet somehow people still fall for it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Problems should create solutions. Solutions shouldnt exist independent
        of problems because more often than not that solution becomes a problem.
        This is why premature optimization is bad. If you dont have optimization
        problems and you burden yourself with optimizing when its not needed
        its giving yourself obsticals you dont need to have there in the first
        place. If its not broken then dont burden yourself with fixing it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Premature optimization is why people don't recommend python. Python 
        isnt a bad language by any means. Python has many problems with it
        like dynamic typing. But people always point at one thing as why they
        think python is bad. Its speed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Python is slow. Python is much much slower than its contemporaries. But
        the problem is that python isnt ment to be fast. Python is supposed to 
        be a simple readable high level language mainly for beginners. Python's
        speed isnt the main problem facing new programmers. The main problem
        they face is finding out what the f*ck they are doing. And having someone
        tell them "Oh dont use python its too slow start with C" isnt helping them,
        its hindering them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pythons speed most of the time isnt a problem. Using just about any major
        programming language guarentees speed and automation that cant be matched
        by a human. So dont tell new programmers to not use python because of speed.
        Because speed shouldnt be a problem until its a problem.
