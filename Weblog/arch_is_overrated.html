    <h1>Log 2 - Arch is Overrated</h1>
    <h2>LJC || 11.28.24</h2>

    <p>
        Arch linux is a linux distribution. One of the most popular distros among
        linux hobbiests for its minimalism and rolling release cycle. But its
        painfully overrated. Dont get me wrong. Arch is a good distro. The problem is 
        that its seen as more unique than it is.
    </p>
    <p>
        Arch has a reputation for 3 things. An elitist community, an extrordinarily hard 
        install process, and beutifully customized desktops. People say "I use 
        arch BTW" ironically or unironically in front of beginner linux users and 
        they think that arch is a monumental task to overcome that has the reward
        of having the most beutifully configured computer ever from all of the
        unixporn arch neofetches they find. And they think since all of these people
        who have these great looking desktops use arch that arch is the greatest
        distro ever when its not.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of the 3 things I mentioned in the section above only 2 are possitive and
        of the 2 left none of them are unique. Arch isnt the hardest OS to install
        not by a long shot. Neither is it the hardest to manage post-install. And
        if archinstall works for you its arguable about as easy and quick as a Fedora
        install. Which makes the bragging about supperior linux knowledge invalid.
        Not that bragging about using a distro is valid in the first place. And
        new linux users think that rices like those of unixporn are unique to Arch.
        Or that minimal installs are unique to Arch when its not the case. You can
        install ubuntu server and run bspwm on it and get a unixporn worthy rice
        without ever having to deal with Arch.
    </p>
    <p>
        And because of this idea of Arch being the OS of linux gods new linux users
        will overlook other distros that could perfectly suit their needs. So Arch's
        reputation overshadows every distro and causes new linux users to distrohop
        more than they should have to because they think that they should build up
        to using Arch otherwise they feel like they arnt as good as Arch users.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use the distro that fits you. Not the one you think is the hardest.
